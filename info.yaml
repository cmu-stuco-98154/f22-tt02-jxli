# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Multiply two 8-bit floating point numbers together (4-bit exponent, 3-bit mantissa)"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Provide two 8-bit floating point numbers 4 bits at a time, use enable pin to provide these bits one set at a time. Wait a while and the product will appear on the output."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "See inputs and a provided testbench"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  ""      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "SystemVerilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  doc_link:     ""      # URL to longer form documentation, eg the README.md in your repository
  clock_hz:     100       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.
